It’s common for students to achieve scores of 95% to 100% yet lack a solid grasp of fundamental math concepts. This often leads to difficulties in higher grades as the subject matter becomes more complex. At Codingal, we provide personalized attention to identify and strengthen areas where each student needs improvement. For those who already excel in the basics, our program advances into more complex areas, including preparation for math Olympiads and increasing challenge levels to keep engagement high. Moreover, to prevent boredom and maintain interest for students who might not feel sufficiently challenged by their school curriculum, Codingal offers a variety of stimulating activities like tab-based exercises and interactive puzzles.":"At Codingal, we recognize that scoring high in school exams doesn’t necessarily reflect a child’s true understanding of math.

These projects help solidify their understanding of app logic, sensors, and APIs, setting the stage for even more complex app development.\u003c0/\u003eThey also start exploring AI-powered features, such as integrating speech recognition or text-to-speech functions, allowing their apps to respond to voice commands or convert text into spoken words. These projects build a strong foundation in coding, sensors, APIs, and AI, preparing students for even more advanced app development.","In partnership with":"In partnership with","In the new digital era, coding helps kids become the creators and not simply consumers of technology.
